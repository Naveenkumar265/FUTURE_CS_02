Password Strength Analyzer Tool Report

Date: 2025-01-14
Overview

This report details the implementation and effectiveness of a Password Strength Analyzer Tool developed using Python. The tool provides a user-friendly interface for users to input their passwords, evaluates the strength of the passwords based on various criteria, and hashes the passwords for security.
Implementation Details

1. Libraries Used:

    tkinter: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
    re: For regular expressions to analyze password strength.
    hashlib: For hashing passwords using SHA-256.

2. Password Strength Criteria:

    Length of at least 8 characters.
    At least one uppercase letter.
    At least one lowercase letter.
    At least one digit.
    At least one special character (e.g., !@#$%^&*()_+).

3. GUI Components:

    An entry field for the user to input their password.
    A button to trigger the password analysis.
    Message boxes to display the strength evaluation and hashed password.

4. Password Strength Evaluation:
The password strength is evaluated by checking how many of the specified criteria the password meets. The tool assigns a strength level based on the number of criteria met:

    0-1 criteria: Very Weak
    2 criteria: Weak
    3 criteria: Moderate
    4 criteria: Strong
    5 criteria: Very Strong

5. Password Hashing:
The tool uses SHA-256 from the hashlib library to hash the password, ensuring that the password is stored securely.
Code Implementation

Python

import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import messagebox
import re
import hashlib

# Function to evaluate password strength
def evaluate_password_strength(password):
    strength = 0
    criteria = [
        (r'.{8,}', 'Length of at least 8 characters'),
        (r'[A-Z]', 'At least one uppercase letter'),
        (r'[a-z]', 'At least one lowercase letter'),
        (r'\d', 'At least one digit'),
        (r'[!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>]', 'At least one special character')
    ]
    passed_criteria = []
    for regex, desc in criteria:
        if re.search(regex, password):
            strength += 1
            passed_criteria.append(desc)
    return strength, passed_criteria
# Function to hash the password
def hash_password(password):
    return hashlib.sha256(password.encode()).hexdigest()

# Function to handle the password analysis
def analyze_password():
    password = password_entry.get()
    strength, passed_criteria = evaluate_password_strength(password)
    strength_levels = ["Very Weak", "Weak", "Moderate", "Strong", "Very Strong"]
    strength_message = f"Strength: {strength_levels[strength]}\n\nCriteria Passed:\n" + "\n".join(passed_criteria)
    hashed_password = hash_password(password)
    messagebox.showinfo("Password Analysis", f"{strength_message}\n\nSHA-256 Hash:\n{hashed_password}")

# Create the GUI
root = tk.Tk()
root.title("Password Strength Analyzer")

tk.Label(root, text="Enter Password:").grid(row=0, column=0, padx=10, pady=10)
password_entry = tk.Entry(root, show="*", width=30)
password_entry.grid(row=0, column=1, padx=10, pady=10)

analyze_button = tk.Button(root, text="Analyze", command=analyze_password)
analyze_button.grid(row=1, columnspan=2, pady=10)

root.mainloop()

Effectiveness

The Password Strength Analyzer Tool effectively encourages users to create stronger passwords by providing immediate feedback on the strength of their passwords. By meeting more criteria, users can ensure their passwords are harder to guess or brute-force. The addition of password hashing using SHA-256 adds an extra layer of security, ensuring that even if the password is intercepted, it cannot be easily deciphered.
Recommendations

    User Education: Educate users on the importance of strong passwords and regularly updating them.
    Further Enhancements: Consider adding more advanced password policies and real-time strength feedback.
    Integration: Integrate the tool into larger systems for comprehensive security checks.

This tool serves as a foundational step towards enhancing password security and can be expanded further based on specific needs and feedback.
Conclusion

The Password Strength Analyzer Tool is a simple yet effective way to promote the use of strong passwords. It leverages Python's capabilities to provide a user-friendly interface and robust security features. The tool is a valuable addition to any security-conscious environment.
